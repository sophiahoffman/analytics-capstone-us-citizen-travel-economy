# A Study of US Citizens' International Travel Patterns During Good and Bad Economic Times

## Executive Summary
An analysis of the effect of the economy as described by the stock market, strength of
the dollar, unemployment, inflation, wealth distribution/disparity, or other factors as
seen appropriate etc. on international travel by US Citizens  

## Motivation
In light of the recent shutdown in travel due to Covid-19, the question came to mind of how, in general, the state of the US economy impacts the travel habits of US citizens. In the last 30 years, we have seen cycles of recession and financial distress and recoveries and well differentiated volatility, allowing an opportunity to perhaps see some trends.  

## Data Question(s)
How much is international travel affected by the economy?  
Is there a lag in change due to preplanned trips?  
Do certain destinations become more popular when the economy is in distress?  
Do certain destinations become less popular?  
Do US citizens change where they travel to based on a change in the strength of the dollar?
